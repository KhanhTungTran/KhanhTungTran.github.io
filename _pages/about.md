Hi, and welcome to my page! I‚Äôm Khanh-Tung Tran (I usually go by Tung), a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/), Ireland, funded by [Research Ireland‚Äôs CRT-AI programme](https://www.crt-ai.ie/). I am supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Harry Nguyen](https://research.ucc.ie/profiles/harry.nguyen@ucc.ie) and [Prof. Barry O‚ÄôSullivan](https://osullivan.ucc.ie/). My research focuses on **cross-lingual alignment** and **multilingual capability** of large language models (LLMs), particularly their applications in low-resource scenarios to promote fair and inclusive LLM development. I am also interested in **agentic AI**, especially (collective) multi-agent systems for developing real-world, collaborative AI applications.
