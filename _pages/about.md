Hi, and welcome to my page! I’m Khanh-Tung Tran (I usually go by Tung), a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University College Cork, Ireland, funded by Research Ireland’s CRT-AI programme. I am supervised by Assoc. Prof. Harry Nguyen and Prof. Barry O’Sullivan. My research focuses on cross-lingual alignment and multilingual capability of large language models (LLMs), particularly their applications in low-resource scenarios to promote fair and inclusive LLM development. I am also interested in agentic AI, especially (collective) multi-agent systems for developing real-world, collaborative AI applications.
